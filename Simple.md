### **Total Estimated Startup Cost**

| Cost Component | Low-End Estimate (₹) | Realistic Mid-Range (₹) |
|---|---|---|
| Machinery & Equipment | ₹ 1,08,800 | **₹ 1,35,000** |
| Raw Material & Inventory | ₹ 40,000 | **₹ 50,000** |
| Contingency (10%) | ₹ 14,880 | **₹ 18,500** |
| **| **Total Investment** | **₹ 1,63,680** | **₹ 2,03,500** |

**In summary, you can realistically start this focused version of your business with an investment of approximately ₹ 1.6 to 2 Lakhs.**

### **Important Notes for This Setup:**

1.  **Product Scope:** With this setup, your main products will be:
    *   **Sublimation Items:** Custom Mugs, Keychains, Coasters.
    *   **Photo Frames:** Standard photo frames with printed photos under glass/acrylic.
    *   **You cannot print on cotton T-shirts** with this setup. Sublimation only works on polyester or polymer-coated surfaces.

2.  **The "Shrink Wrap" Method:** For frames, the most common professional method is to print the photo, place it on the backing, cover it with a clear PVC sheet, and use a heat gun to shrink the PVC tightly. This creates a sealed, glass-like finish without actual glass. The cost above includes this method.

3.  **Next Steps:**
    *   Get specific printer quotes (Epson converted models are popular for startups).
    *   Source a local supplier for frame mouldings to save on shipping.
    *   Practice the sublimation process and frame assembly to perfect quality before selling.

This is a very manageable and profitable starting point. You can always add a DTF printer for T-shirts later as your business grows.
