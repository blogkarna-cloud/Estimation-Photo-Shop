*   This assumes a core setup of: **DTF Printer, Sublimation Printer, Heat Press, Manual Frame Cutting Tools, and initial raw material for 3-6 months.**
*   **Important Next Steps:**
    1.  **Space:** Rent a 200-300 sq. ft. space with good power connection (commercial electricity).
    2.  **Vendor Research:** Get exact quotes for machinery from local dealers. Chinese imports are cheaper but service is key.
    3.  **Skill Development:** Learn to operate the DTF and Sublimation printers perfectly. Practice is key to quality.
    4.  **Business Plan:** Don't forget marketing costs (website, social media, shop signage) which can be an additional ₹ 50,000 - ₹ 1,00,000.

This business has high potential, especially around festivals and personal gifting seasons. Start with a focused product list and expand as you grow your customer base.
